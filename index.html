<h3>A little about myself</h3>
<p>I am Haseeb Saadut and I was born in Georgia. I lived in New York after that for a couple of months, before heading down to Virginia. That is where we stayed for many years, until we came back in the south. So here I am again, back to square one. I love IT and hopefully get a job relevant to that subject. Worked on many projects, and able to learn new programs rather quickly. </p>
